# Portfolio README

Welcome to my portfolio repository! This is where I showcase my projects, skills, and experiences. Recently, I made a significant change in the deployment infrastructure, transitioning from Vercel to Serverless Stack (SST) on AWS.

## Why the Change?

The decision to move from Vercel to SST on AWS was driven by the desire to explore a different approach from the mainstream and leverage the benefits of Serverless Stack. While Vercel is a popular platform, I wanted to experiment with a solution that scales seamlessly and offers more control over the deployment environment.

## About SST and AWS

### Serverless Stack (SST):
SST is a framework that simplifies the development and deployment of serverless applications. It provides a convenient and efficient way to manage AWS CloudFormation stacks for serverless architectures.

### Amazon Web Services (AWS):
AWS is a comprehensive cloud platform, offering a wide range of services for computing, storage, databases, machine learning, and more. By utilizing AWS with SST, my portfolio can take advantage of the scalability and reliability of AWS infrastructure.
